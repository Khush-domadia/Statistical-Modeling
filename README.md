## ðŸ›  Techniques and Methods

The following statistical and machine learning techniques are explored:

1. **Linear Regression**
   - Simple linear regression models for numerical data.
   - Analyzing relationships between dependent and independent variables.

2. **Multivariable Regression**
   - Modeling relationships between multiple predictors and an outcome.

3. **Classification**
   - Categorical outcome predictions using logistic regression and other classifiers.

4. **Logistic Regression**
   - Analysis of binary and multinomial outcomes.

5. **Resampling**
   - Applying techniques like cross-validation and bootstrapping for robust model evaluation.

6. **k-Fold Cross-Validation**
   - Ensuring model performance consistency across multiple data splits.

7. **Visualization**
   - Extensive visualizations for model results, data distributions, and performance metrics.
